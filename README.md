# Automated Systematic Review Datasets

This project contains the simulations study for the [Automated Systematic
Review](https://github.com/msdslab/automated-systematic-review) project. This
repository is used to simulate, aggregate and visualise the active learning
process.

We make use of the SURFSara HPC infrastructure.
